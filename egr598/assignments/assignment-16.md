## Overview

Please prepare your group presentation based on your most recent project activities

### Create an outline for your report.  

It may look something like

1. Introduction
    * State the goal of your device,
    * State the goal of your project.  How does your design approach, selected models and analysis, prototyping plan, selected sensors, and experimentation plan go together to iteratively improve your design?
1. Background
    a. biomechanics
    b. bio-inspired robots
    c. laminates
1. Design Workflow - The assumptions, models, analysis, etc in the report should be updated to match your final prototype, not your initial.  
    a. robot specifications
    a. proposed mechanism (with labeled figures, dimensions, parts, etc)
    b. motion calculations (discuss the constraint equations you use, code(in appendix), plots of resulting motion)
    c. jacobian calculation - describe any decisions or assumptions made
    d. force/power calculations (force / torque assumptions, speed assumptions)
    e. motor sizing / selection
    f. manufacturing planning & computation
        * description of how you compute your manufacturing files, assumptions you make, what tools you use, your code(in appendix), and the plots of your cut files step by step.
    g. parts list with number, weight, cost
    g. experimental validation procedure, with figure of setup
1. Results  
    * Tell/show/plot data collected that reveals the performance of your device, across each prototype.
    * Propose your display method to me in advance of your final report
1. Discussion
    * Discuss how experimental results compared against your model should lead to next prototype, potential downsides of your approach, things not explored
1. References
1. Appendix
    1. Prototypes
        a. prototype I
            - picture
            - description
            - what was it made to tell you about?
            - what you learned?
            - what decisions did it lead you to make in the next iteration
        b. prototype II...
            - repeat as above
    1. Code
        * full code for all your calculations, commented

### Assemble your report.  

Take all previous group assignments and insert them in your outline as appropriate.

### Update your report

* If you have made major structural changes to your design, please update the report as needed.  This report should report on the final device, not the initial concept.

### Report on the performance of your integrated device

* Discuss your progress actuating your device, collecting data, and interpreting your results.
* Answer the questions I have specifically asked your team over the last 2 weeks.

**This can go straight in your report, and this should be the focus of your presentation**

## Suggestions

A successful project report/presentation will do the following:

1. **Address** deficiencies from the previous presentation.
1. **Discuss** your progress using your project's report outline.  What do you need to know and need to address to be successful?
1. **Present** the most recent design iteration.  It should be a physical device, produced as a result of the last presentation.  Bring it, pass it around
1. **Report** observations you have made of the device moving, modeling and analysis results you have calculated, and/or sensor data you have obtained, depending on the most recent class topics and group assignments.  By the end you should have considered the complete design workflow.  The reporting of data should be related to the current class module and follow up from previous modules.
1. **Discuss** how these observations translate into upcoming design changes, with regard to motion & kinematics, dynamics, sensing, control, etc.  Present *new* concepts/renderings/animations, design files, etc.
1. **Answer** any questions.

## Viewing

As a viewer you have a responsibility to ask three questions to the team.  These questions will be collected and addressed by the team in subsequent presentations.

## Submissions

For teams presenting, please submit a ppt and writeup.  For teams not presenting, please submit the writeup.
