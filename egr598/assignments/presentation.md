## Overview

Please prepare your group presentation based on your most recent project activities

### Bi-weekly Topics:

1. Bio-inspiration
1. Kinematics & Forces
1. Manufacturing
1. Mechatronics, Motors, Sensors
1. Dynamics & Stiffness
1. ...more to come

## Suggestions

A successful project presentation will do the following:

1. **Address** deficiencies from the previous presentation.
1. **Discuss** your progress using your project's report outline.  What do you need to know and need to address to be successful?
1. **Present** the most recent design iteration.  It should be a physical device, produced as a result of the last presentation.  Bring it, pass it around
1. **Report** observations you have made of the device moving, modeling and analysis results you have calculated, and/or sensor data you have obtained, depending on the most recent class topics and group assignments.  By the end you should have considered the complete design workflow.  The reporting of data should be related to the current class module and follow up from previous modules.
1. **Discuss** how these observations translate into upcoming design changes, with regard to motion & kinematics, dynamics, sensing, control, etc.  Present *new* concepts/renderings/animations, design files, etc.
1. **Answer** any questions.

## Viewing

As a viewer you have a responsibility to ask three questions to the team.  These questions will be collected and addressed by the team in subsequent presentations.
