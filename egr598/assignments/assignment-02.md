## Assignment Overview
The goal of this assignment is to search externally for origami-inspired mechanisms you could use for your project.  Additionally, this assignment is meant to make you think critically about how the manufacturing of foldable robots is intertwined with cutting and joining processes, and to appreciate the automation

## Steps

1. Read this paper[@Winder2009].  Look through the other references, including the book by Birmingham[@Birmingham].
1. Find 5 unique popup mechanisms online (image, link, description)
1. You are making a two-page popup book...essentially the two covers.  When you open the book, your machine is revealed by popping up.  
    * You can pick your input mechanism to be the book opening, or to be some other input device like a tab-and-slot, or both, but it should be clear what simple translations or rotations power your book's motion.
    * the machine should be composed of more than one mechanism, connected in series or parallel as you see fit, and you should use an example of a planar and spherical joint somewhere in it.  Identify what is what.
    * pick a material: something like poster-board or stiff cardstock(I have some available, please come see me)
    * Focus on generating interesting motion, not tesselations or repeating patterns, using the opening of the book or some other constrained input mechansim like a tab/slot.

<!--
1. Identify the number of degrees of freedom of the device
1. Describe the output motion produced, relative to the input motion
1. Solve for and plot the *motion* of at least one sub-mechanism in your device using Python/Jupyter.
-->

## Hints and Ideas

* Consider your manufacturing methods: if you cut by hand, use a straightedge and x-acto.  
* Consider using a laser cutter to score sheet or weaken.
* Consider taping or reinforcing joints.

## Discussion

* What is the hardest part of fabrication, planning or executing?  How did you cut your material, and would your answer be different if you had cut it a different way?
* Discuss the deficiency of using the same material at your link as your joint.  What strategies did you turn to in order to solve this problem?
* **Optional:** did you use more than one layer to accomplish your mechanism?  If not, how would you be able to make your mechanism more space-efficient?  If so, do you think it's possible to translate your solution to 1 layer of paper?-

<!--
* Can you see any obvious problems with the way you solved your kinematics?
-->

## Submission

In a pdf:

* Include the mechansims you found online (image, link, description)
* Draw/plot the cut pattern for each layer of your popup book, using mountain/valley/cut notation
* Include photos of your popup book open, closed, and midway.
* Include Discussion

<!--* Include code and plot of sub-mechanism-->

Separately:

* Include a video of your popup book moving.
<!--* code, either as a .py  or .ipynb file.-->
