# Overview

***Foldable Robotics*** is a course organized around new types of robots being developed in research labs and industry across the country.  These devices are designed and built using layered, flat sheets of a wide variety of materials, and folded up to create both form and motion.  This class studies these devices from initial prototype and design through implementation and optimization, with a focus on application-specific projects which seek to solve problems of cost, parallelism, complexity, and time with a relatively fast and easy prototyping method.  

This class allows students to delve deeper into the analytical problems associated with these devices, in topics such as design, manufacturing, dynamics & simulation, optimization, kinematics & motion, and stiffness analysis.

## Course Objectives

At the end of this course, students will demonstrate proficiency in:

* Prototyping skills and rapid prototyping techniques using digital equipment like laser cutters, 3D printers, etc.
* Mechanism synthesis techniques using physical prototypes.
* Identifying and conducting background reading on related research from the fields of biomechanics, robotics, and manufacturing.
* Making laminate robots using the principles of layer-based process constraints.
* Plotting the motion of foldable mechanisms using kinematic constraint equations.
* Understanding degrees of freedom, constraints.
* Simulating the motion of dynamic systems.
* Experimental design and implementation.
* Synthesizing concepts from across engineering domains including robotics, CAD/CAM design, manufacturing & rapid prototyping, analysis, and optimization.
* Object-oriented programming techniques using Python
* Producing software packages in Python that give insight into design, robotics, and manufacturing.

## Prerequisites
* Should be familiar with programming fundamentals, ideally scripted languages like Python or Matlab.
* Should be familiar with linear algebra, differential equations, calculus, trigonometry, vectors, etc.
* Should be comfortable working around rapid prototyping machines, and if not, willing to learn.
<!--* Should be willing to try a different operating system.-->

## Materials, Equipment, and personal laptops

**Computers:** It is expected that you can bring a laptop to class to complete in-class programming tasks.  You will be expected to install and use Python.  This class is friendly to all operating systems, but I will be using a windows machine, so that may be easiest.  Others have used Ubuntu or OS/X on their own in the past with no problems.

<!--There are 20 workstations arranged around the perimeter of Tech 162 with computers.  Anaconda is already installed, but it will be difficult to follow along when you're pointed the other direction from the front of the room.  We will use the workstations for your device development, but if you are able, please bring laptops to class.  You'll be able to follow along in the front a lot easier.  If you don't have a laptop that you can bring, we'll try to put you in the closer workstations.
-->

**Textbook:** There is no textbook.  Selected readings from will be provided on blackboard and/or linked to online.

**Materials:** There is no course fee; students will be responsible for obtaining consumable materials used in their project, such as cardboard, adhesive, plastic, etc.  We may be able to supply a limited number of motors, sensors, and controllers which can be used for development, but if students wish to keep their robots they will need to purchase their own components.

**Equipment:** Special equipment for making laminate robots will be available on the Poly Campus.  You will need to become familiar with the tools and equipment in the Innovation Hub.

## Homework

Homework will be assigned weekly, and will cover the topics presented in class.  The focus of the homework will be to help establish a fundamental understanding of the topics required to create foldable robots using coding to design, manufacture, and analyze.

## Project

The final project will involve making a foldable robot using the design methods introduced in this class.   The project will span the entire semester.  Teams of 2-3 students will propose a research question they would like to focus on in the realm of foldable robotics.  They will survey the state of research on this topic, and craft a project of appropriate scope (with the guidance of the professor) and depth that can be accomplished in the time frame.   They will then develop a design workflow, code, and a robot which investigates this theme further.

Each week, students will bring their assignments or projects to class and we will discuss their progress & roadblocks.

<!--
## Learn Linux
Depending on what software you need for your programming assignments and projects, you may want to consider using Linux, which has a variety of software not available for Windows machines.  We have also VirtualBox on the class computers, so that you can run Ubuntu Linux in order to access this software.  If you've ever wanted to try out Ubuntu, this is a good opportunity, as you should be able to complete all assignments and projects with the open-source software available in Ubuntu.  So if you want the challenge, consider installing virtualbox on your computer and downloading and installing Ubuntu 16.04 LTS on it.  I have a recipe for installing Anaconda for Ubuntu as well.
-->

### Entrepreneurial Mindset and the 3 C's

**Curiosity:** Laminate robotics permits students to iterate quickly and investigate new mechanisms using ultra-low-cost, origami-inspired prototyping techniques. Motion can be prototyped via folding, permitting students without the technical, programming, or mathematical background to participate in a development process which is usually reserved for experts in design, simulation, robotics, control, and/or computer science.  Through these manufacturing activities, students become motivated to become experts, leaving the class with a taste for the design process and an appreciation for the complexity of robotics.  This class will accelerate those prototyping abilities by providing high-performance hardware for class projects as needed.

**Creating Value:** This course will focus on several real-world application areas (such as mine-clearing, terrestrial locomotion, agriculture, etc) in order to solve problems which laminate robots are better suited to address than traditional robots.  These applications will be pitched by both instructor and student during the first few weeks.  Each application should share core challenges in design, analysis, modeling, and experimentation, requiring teams to simulate, prototype, and test early and often.  Applications should have a real-world connection in which traditional robot solutions have failed, or not yet been developed.  Laminate robots, fabricated at low cost and with fewer moving parts, are more resilient to dirt, dust, and damage while lowering the impact if something does indeed break.  Selected applications should also consider laminate robots’ ability to operate in parallel to improve the health, safety, and security of high-risk areas around the world.

**Connections:**  This class will connect students to opportunities in a way other classes don't.  Whether its attached to the human body, out in the desert, or in an office, we will test projects in their native environments to help identify core design challenges related to their selected application.  This will help  focus designs early and to motivate how to address the real challenges of making robots solve "real world" challenges.  In addition, this course will host guest lectures from several ASU faculty working on these concepts, as well as a special guest lecture from an industrial partner.

# Class Schedule

The class schedule can be found on blackboard as well as at this [link](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=fqgd7f7a52v6ub2gek59mu5sus%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FPhoenix).  It will be updated regularly. It is your responsibility to keep track of due dates.

**Consulting: ** I will ask that groups find a common time to meet with me for a bi-weekly consulting session prior to and throughout their final project, to be used to help identify a unique problem worth solving, and to craft a suitable scope, and to discuss issues, questions, and ideas.


Unless otherwise specified, assignments are due before class time (10:30am) on the day it is due.

## Grading Rubric

In general, this is my interpretation of what a particular grade means.  Not all assignments will be graded with a letter, but my objective is to match this general idea:

| Grade | Description                                                                                                                                                                |
|:------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| A+    | Shows superior effort, quality, mastering of the concepts, and innovation in execution.  Documentation is nearly publication-ready.                                        |
| A     | Demonstrates a complete understanding of the problem, and solution is well executed, documented, and presented.                                                            |
| B     | Meets expectations.  Minor mistakes are permitted, but student demonstrates a general understanding of the concepts.  Documentation present but perhaps not comprehensive. |
| C     | Some effort shown, though there may be some critical flaws in thinking or execution.  Documentation is present but lacking in critical areas.                              |
| D     | Minimal effort shown.  Does not show understanding and may not have though through their methods.  Documentation is severely lacking.                                      |
| E     | No effort shown.  No documentation of work                                                                                                                                 |

## Attendance & Participation

This class is structured so that it can only be successful with your assistance.  Classes will be interactive, and will require you to come with questions, answers, and ideas to discuss.  Students should notify me if they will miss class, although this does not excuse them from learning the concepts or turning in their assignments on time.  

Accommodations will be made for religious observances provided that students notify the instructor at the beginning of the semester concerning those dates.  Students who expect to miss class due to officially university-sanctioned activities should inform the instructor early in the semester.  Alternative arrangements will generally be made for any examinations and other graded in-class work affected by such absences. The preceding policies are based on [ACD 304–04](http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd304-04.html), “Accommodation for Religious Practices” and [ACD 304–02](http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd304-02.html), “Missed Classes Due to University-Sanctioned Activities.”

Minus the above exceptions, missing more than **two** classes will result in noticeable penalties to students' participation grade.  Please coordinate with your fellow students to make sure someone takes notes during class if you will be unavoidably gone.  The participation grade will reflect your contribution to class, office hour sessions, and planned group meetings.  

## Readings, Assignments, Examinations, Special Materials, Required Activities

Readings and assignments will be posted to blackboard throughout the semester.  It is the student's responsibility to check periodically for announcements and posted material.

Due to the nature of this class, failing to turn in an assignment on time affects you and your classmates, as each concept builds on the last.  It is your responsibility to get in touch with the instructor regarding any questions before assignments are due.  Late submissions will lose one letter grade for every day they are late.

All assignments must be posted to blackboard ***before class*** on the day it is due

We will be participating in the Innovation Showcase on Friday, April 27.  Individual attendance is not required, but participation is.  Students should coordinate with the instructor to ensure that their project can be operated or displayed.

<!--We will coordinate on the first day of class to determine an appropriate way to submit assignments and projects.  They will be due before class on the day indicated; this process will likely be automated,  so late assignments will not be recorded(or automatically marked as late).  It will be your responsibility to submit late assignments to me *via email* as well.  The date and time the email was received will determine the number of late days.-->

<!--
Students are allowed **five** late days to submit individual assignments, to be used as they see fit.  There are no late days available for group assignments or projects.  It is the responsibility of students to keep track of the number of late days they have used.
-->

## Classroom Behavior

**Cell phones, pagers, and other personal devices** must be turned off during class to avoid causing distractions.  The use of recording devices is not permitted during class.  Any violent or threatening conduct by an ASU student in this class will be reported to the ASU Police Department and the Office of the Dean of Students.  

**Use of laptops in class:**  Laptops are strongly suggested for this course.  You may use your laptop to take notes, during tutorial sessions, or when giving presentations.  Please do not use class time for emails, chats, web browsing, or other non-class related activities.


## Academic Integrity

This class is meant to teach you how to create and use your own design tools for creating folding robots using a variety of published resources, online resources, and classroom content.  I encourage you to plumb the depths of what's available; through this synthesis you might be able to create something unique.  However, I expect to be able to tell what is your work and what is someone else's.  For this reason, when you submit assignments, follow these guidelines:

* Do your own work for individual assignments and tests.
* Include the your sources of inspiration within assignments and projects.  This will help grow the list of cool references, but more importantly, help distinguish inspiration from wholesale plagarism.
* Keep code/text/information you use from outside sources separate from your own original content (through the use of separate folders, for example).  Make it explicit what is yours and what is not.
* Include all the licenses or copyright statements as required by the things you reuse.  This will make your own code more reuseable for yourself and potentially others in the future.

All students in this class are subject to ASU’s Academic Integrity Policy (available at <http://provost.asu.edu/academicintegrity>) and should acquaint themselves with its content and requirements, including a strict prohibition against plagiarism.  All violations will be reported to the Dean’s office, who maintain records of all offenses.  Students are expected to abide by the FSE Honor Code (<http://engineering.asu.edu/integrity/>).
You are also expected to abide by the [Computer, Internet, and Electronic Communications Information Management Policy](http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd125.html).

<!--# Background
This class is emerging from a class called *Informal Robotics*, taught at the Harvard Graduate School of Design in 2015 and 2016.  This class was developed by Chuch Hoberman, Daniel Aukes, and Jonathan Grinham, and introduced this and similar manufacturing methods to a group of mostly graduate students in design along with students from Harvard College, the School of Engineering and Applied Science, and MIT Engineering Students.  Classes paired lessons on the essentials of design, deployable structures, kinematics, manufacturing, and mechatronics, while presentations by guest researchers provided the context by which students understood the impact these new prototyping methods are having in research labs.  This class was the first joint collaboration between the Wyss Institute and the Harvard Graduate School of Design, and resulted in a symposium titled "Informal Robotics" in October 2016 which brought several high-impact researchers to the GSD to speak about their work in the field.

## Proposed Focus
Laminate Robotics will focus more deeply on the engineering topics required to be able to develop not only this class of devices, but to enable students to craft their own design tools from scratch as new manufacturing methods emerge from the research lab.  This class will focus on topics essential to robot designers, from kinematic and dynamic analysis and simulation, to strength of materials and FEA.

### Kinematics
The kinematics of laminate devices is inherently complex, because the network of folds created in 2D are spherical, nonlinear, and begin moving from a kinematic singularity.  All of these factors makes it non-intuitive to visualize and design motion from a network of rotational hinges.  We will introduce the concept of reference frames, degrees of freedom, and transformations, and demonstrate how these tools can be applied to serial and parallel systems consisting of rotational and translational elements.
- Suggested reading: McCarthy

### Dynamics
Extending on the kinematics section, we will discuss the concepts of stiffness and damping as a function of the material properties of these multi-material systems, and analyze and discuss the impact rotational stiffness can have on an ideal kinematic system.  While the materials are typically lightweight, weight and inertia can also play a role in systems dominated by soft passive elements.  We will introduce tools for creating equations of motion and simulating multi-rigid-body systems.
- Suggested Reading: Kane

### Simulation
Students will be introduced to the basics of dynamic simulation and be given the opportunity to create a simulation for a particular dynamic system.  Performance of their device will be evaluated across several scenarios and parameter sets, with students being asked to find and optimize designs.

### Manufacturing
The analysis of flat laminate systems requires pairing an understanding of the mathematical representation of laminates with the abilities, constraints, and limitations of the manufacturing methods used to make them.  We will introduce concepts such as constructive solid geometry, tool workspace, assembly/disassembly in order to provide students an understanding of manufacturability for this process.
- Suggested Reading: ?

### Stiffness Analysis
As these systems are composed of materials as soft as plastic, paper, and cardboard, and as rigid as fiberglass, carbon fiber, and steel, there can be a wide range of performance with respect to the material systems used.  However, it has been observed that the precise kinematics of such systems can deviate widely from nominal in the presence of links which bend and deform under load.  This can have the effect of increasing the effective degrees of freedom, permitting unintended bending and twisting, which can result in shorter system lifespan and unintended, unmodeled behavior.  We will introduce the basic elements of FEA in order to analyze system performance.
-->
<!--
## Final Projects

### Design Tool Creation
We will ask students to create a design tool for a novel manufacturing system, programmed in Python.  This  project will permit students to create reusable planning software which they can use to

### Simulation Project
Simulate the performance of a class of designs, find global optimum

# Students with Disabilities

\small

Suitable accommodations will be made for students having disabilities and students should notify the instructor as early as possible if they will require same.  Such students must be registered with the Disability Resource Center and provide documentation to that effect.

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal antidiscrimination statute that provides comprehensive civil rights protection for persons with disabilities. One element of this legislation requires that all qualified students with documented disabilities be guaranteed a learning environment that provides for reasonable accommodation of their disabilities. If you believe you have a disability requiring an accommodation please contact the Disability Resource Center at ASU Polytechnic located in Student Affairs Quad # 4 or call 480-727-1039 / TTY: 480-727-1009.  Eligibility and documentation policies are online at:  <http://www.asu.edu/studentaffairs/ed/drc/>

## Sexual Discrimination

\small

Title IX is a federal law that provides that no person be excluded on the basis of sex from participation in, be denied benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity.  Both Title IX and university policy make clear that sexual violence and harassment based on sex is prohibited.  An individual who believes they have been subjected to sexual violence or harassed on the basis of sex can seek support, including counseling and academic support, from the university.  If you or someone you know has been harassed on the basis of sex or sexually assaulted, you can find information and resources at <https://sexualviolenceprevention.asu.edu/faqs..  

As a mandated reporter, I am obligated to report any information I become aware of regarding alleged acts of sexual discrimination, including sexual violence and dating violence.  ASU Counseling Services, <https://eoss.asu.edu/counseling>, is available if you wish discuss any concerns confidentially and privately.
