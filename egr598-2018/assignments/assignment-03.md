## Overview

The goal of this assignment is to permit those interested in pitching their ideas to attract a group of people interested in joining them.  There is a requirement to have 3 students per team, so this pitch will be used to promote ideas and discussion amongst students before they have to decide.

## Instructions

1. Create two slides: one slide summarizing project background, and another summarizing project goals.
    * discuss how your project satisfies all project requirements.
    * this is your opportunity to shape your semester and to accomplish a personal goal through class.
1. Present your pitch in class on Thursday, January 18.
1. Complete [this survey](https://goo.gl/forms/MPxhfRaARMt3mUSr2) afterwards to indicate your preference.

## Submission instructions
* slides can be in .pptx or pdf.  If pptx, beware of videos with dead links, unembedded fonts, missing codecs, etc.  I can't play what's not embedded.

### Due Dates:
