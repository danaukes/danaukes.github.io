## Overview

The purpose of this exercise is for your team to confirm your motor against speed *and* torque requirements

## Procedure : Identify requirements

1. Review and update your speed requirements as determined by your bio-inspiration or known device performance specifications.
1. Using your previous group assignment as a starting point, update your path & Jacobian calculations if necessary using your most recent kinematics.  Update your torque requirements to match.
1. Compute the output velocity as a function of your input(actuator) velocity, using the equation $\dot{q}_{out} = J\dot{q}_{in}$. Increase your input velocity until the output velocity meets your desired specifications
1. Using $P=f^Tv=\tau^T\omega$, compute the required power of your motors
