## Overview

Please prepare your group presentation based on your most recent project activities

### Bi-weekly Topic:

1. Show / Tell me what your final robot will look like.  
    * What aspects of the design are you hoping to focus on?  This should inform your design/simulate/experiment
    * What will people see at the innovation showcase.  Plan how you will present this work and engage people.
1. What methods will you use to understand your robot and to search through your design space?  What kinds of simulations support the design questions you are asking?
1  How will you test designs and evaluate them?  This should mesh well with your design goal.  Will you
    * Sense forces with a load cell?
    * Sense accelerations with an IMU
    * Voltage / Current with an onboard sensor  
    * Take high speed video of motion?
1. What additonal parts and materials do you need?  Please prepare your parts list and budget, based on your design goal and test plan.
1. Please present your manufacturing process plan and cut-file generation script/file.  Scripted is preferred, popupCAD is allowed, other methods will not be permitted in your final report.
1. Please discuss your selected motor & connection concept, including CAD models if you are 3d printing anything.  You do not need it executed until next time.
    * we have plastic pop rivets available
    * 3d printing via the innovation hub is permitted for modular connectors

## Suggestions

A successful project report/presentation will do the following:

1. **Address** deficiencies from the previous presentation.
1. **Discuss** your progress using your project's report outline.  What do you need to know and need to address to be successful?
1. **Present** the most recent design iteration.  It should be a physical device, produced as a result of the last presentation.  Bring it, pass it around
1. **Report** observations you have made of the device moving, modeling and analysis results you have calculated, and/or sensor data you have obtained, depending on the most recent class topics and group assignments.  By the end you should have considered the complete design workflow.  The reporting of data should be related to the current class module and follow up from previous modules.
1. **Discuss** how these observations translate into upcoming design changes, with regard to motion & kinematics, dynamics, sensing, control, etc.  Present *new* concepts/renderings/animations, design files, etc.
1. **Answer** any questions.

## Viewing

As a viewer you have a responsibility to ask three questions to the team.  These questions will be collected and addressed by the team in subsequent presentations.

## Submissions

For teams presenting, please submit a ppt and writeup.  For teams not presenting, please submit the writeup.
