## Overview

Compute the stiffness of a laminate beam

### Summary of Steps

1. Prepare rectangular samples of cardboard / fiberglass and polyester in the dimensions 25mm x 50mm.  It may be useful to cut a small hole at the end of each beam. (for a string)
1. Measure the deflection of each material as a function of a small amount of weight.  Suggestion: use paperclips, small amounts of water, etc. and then measure or calculate the mass afterwards.  Or use calibrated weights.
1. Measure the thickness of each material
1. Using the code presented and discussed in class, compute the young's modulus for each material based on the deflection and point load at the end.
1. Using your estimate for each layer's stiffness, compute the stiffness of a 5-layer composite of those materials.  Estimate the deflection of the beam given a small load
1. Create a 5-layer triangular laminate of cardboard/fiberglass, adhesive, and polyester, with dimensions 25x50mm (and an attachment point / hole near the end.)
1. Measure the deflection of the laminate with the same load and report your findings.


### Suggestions

* Test individual layers to start
* please adapt the geometry to suit your own project as needed.  Describe the differences
* Document your process
* I will be forgiving on precision, but I want to know what you did and how you did it
* You may use scissors, but you will need to measure what you cut then.

### Submission

This assignment should be submitted as a writeup of your individual process.  Describe your approach to each of the steps in the assignment.  Provide pictures, code, and figures as necessary to make the point.  This work can be combined and put in your group's final report, but the work for this assignment should be individual.  You may coordinate with your group, however, so that each of your teammates test different design points however.
