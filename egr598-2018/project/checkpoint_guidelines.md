## Presenting

A successful checkpoint presentation will do the following:

1. **Present** the most recent design iteration.  It should be a physical device, produced as a result of the last presentation
1. **Report** observations you have made of the device moving, modeling and analysis results you have calculated, and/or sensor data you have obtained.  There is no requirement to all sources each week, but by the end you should have considered each of these components.  The reporting of data should be related to the current class module and follow up on previous modules.
1. **Discuss** how these observations translate into upcoming design changes, with regard to motion & kinematics, dynamics, sensing, control, etc.  Present *new* renderings/animations, design files, etc.
1. **Answer** any questions or address deficiencies from the previous presentation.

## Viewing

As a viewer you have a responsibility to ask three questions to the team.  These questions will be collected and addressed by the team in subsequent presentations.

## Final Note

Remember final project requirements to document fabrication process and the evolution of your designs start to finish.  Doing a little bit each week will make your final submission more complete and easier to manage.
