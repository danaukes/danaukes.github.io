Introduction
------------

Foldable robots is a class about fusion.  Fusing knowledge across a wide number of domains so that you can cobble together an understanding of a new and very exciting type of device being developed in the classroom and for research.

This class will teach you the basics about a variety of topics, ranging from bio-inspired design principles, materials, manufacturing, design, stiffness analysis, kinematics, dynamics, robotics, origami, graphics, and programming.  It will introduce you to the trends in many of these fields and give you a working understanding of the rest.  Most importantly, it will give you the vocabulary used by the experts; in this age of ubiquitous computing, the most important thing is to know how to ask the right question.  Once you can do that, finding the right answer is easy.  This book will help you learn that vocabulary.

Foldable devices have emerged from a variety of considerations, but one of the biggest is the deficiencies of traditional robots.  While there are a wide range of robots out there, traditional robots are usually stiff, heavy affairs with rigid links, low-backlash transmissions, high tolerances, and precise, high-power, rapid motion.  Foldable robots try to approach tasks from a different perspective.  At  scales such as the millimeter / centimeter scale, traditional mechanisms are neither feasible nor available.  Traditional systems composed from bearings, gears, motors, belts, drives, and pulleys, are simply too large to fit on small devices.  MEMS-based solutions require cleanroom facilities and produce geometries which are too small.  So to facilitate building precise robotic devices at the millimeter scale, a group of researchers have been

| precise     | less precise |

| stiff       | soft         |

Foldable robots are also attractive because they can leverage the precision of digital fabrication techniques now commonly available in your average "maker space".  While the 3d printer has received most of the attention, it is often claimed that the laser cutter is the most heavily used device in a maker space.  With nothing more than cardboard, plastic film, and adhesive, multi-material hinged mechanisms can be made with all the precision available to a modern laser cutter.  These mechanisms form the backbone of foldable robots, and with the right setup, this planar fabrication mentality can extend to circuits and actuators too.

There is a common problem in the field of robotics, which is that in order to create a more unique story and more-publishable paper, researchers think of and represent their robot as a completely unique permutation of challenges and solutions... in other words the first to solve a very specific problem, and the best and solving it.  Yes, there may have been a number of robots to come before, and yes, the terminology in their particular sub-field may already have been established and defined, but because of the unique set of constraints which has been somewhat-artificially established, the researcher gives him or herself permission to ignore prior methods or best practices and do their own thing.  This leads to a highly segmented design space, with little thought to how one given design addresses previous problems or solutions.  This is my attempt to help unify some of these problems in laminate robots.  To acknowledge the simliarities,  highlight the differences, and smooth out the design space a little bit, so that we can all approach this design problem with a common set of terms and, perhaps, thought processes.

This reader has two purposes: 1) to teach you how to design and build foldable robotic devices using the tools available in a maker space, and 2) to teach you how to make and use design tools which can help you solve your own problems in this field.  Foldable robots are still new, and because of that, there are very few resources available outside of an extensive paper review.  I will attempt to put together the information required to conceptualize, design, create the manufacturing files for, and build a laminate device from scratch.  It will also lead you to
