## Existing Biomechanics Literature

Starting Points:

* On being the right size "A rat is killed, a man is broken, a horse splashes." [@Haldane1964]
* Gravity and life on the ground.[@Vogel2006]
* How Animals Move: An Integrative View[@Dickinson2000]
* Froude number [@Alexander2009]

### People
* Dickenson - Animal Locomotion
* Biewener - Muscles
* McMahon, Herr - Human Running
* Lauder  - fish
* Maciver  - knifefish
* Full - Crabs, Cockroaches, Geckos, etc.
* Autumn - Geckos, Gecko Adhesives
* Goldman - Turtles, Granular Locomotion, Ants, etc.

### Properties of Biological Materials

It's useful to know the range of material properties that biological systems can achieve.  Soft materials include muscle, cartiledge, tendon.  Strong Materials form the structural elements of biological systems, like skeletons, shells, teeth,
