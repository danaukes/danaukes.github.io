## Opening Jupyter

open up a command prompt or terminal and type

```
jupyter notebook
```

A browser with the jupyter folder interface should open.   Navigate to the file you want to run and select it.  It will open in a new tab and you can use the menu to learn how to run the entire file or one cell at a time.  Errors and values will be seen for each cell.

1. **Navigate to a working directory.**
1. **Start a new Python 3 document.**
1. **Enter code in the cells.**  
    * Cells can be code, markdown or one or two other types I won't get into.
    * **There is a code mode and a cell mode.** Hit escape when entering text to enter cell mode.  Click on text to enter code mode.
4. **Run the block.** Use shift+enter to run a block and advance to the next.
